# Breast Cancer Detection

## Overview

This project aims to detect breast cancer using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset that contains various features related to tumors, allowing for classification of tumors as benign or malignant.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `breast_cancer_dataset.csv`, which includes the following features:

- **id**: Unique identifier for each tumor
- **diagnosis**: Tumor diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
- Various measurements (mean, worst, etc.) related to tumor characteristics:
  - radius
  - texture
  - perimeter
  - area
  - smoothness
  - compactness
  - concavity
  - concave points
  - symmetry
  - fractal dimension
